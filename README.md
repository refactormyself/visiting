# An Implementation of the "VISITOR" pattern in C++
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/refactormyself/visitor-pattern.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/refactormyself/visitor-pattern.svg?branch=main) 


Using more practical names like "Opreation" and "Perform", instead of visit and co.

I made notes on this pattern [here](www.refactored.live/notes/visitor-pattern-cpp)

#### This Project also illustrates very basic stuffs like
- [CMakeList file](./CMakeLists.txt)
- [MakeFile](./Makefile)
- [Travis CI yaml file](./.travis.yml)

### Try it out
Just clone and run this script: `. ./run.sh`   
Nothing fancy, the focus is the pattern and basic tool setup.
